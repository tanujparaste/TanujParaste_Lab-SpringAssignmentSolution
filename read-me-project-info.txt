The project requires a database to store essential information.
Make sure that the database is already created and available before running the application.

Creating a database in MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS student_tracker_db;

Run the application, all required tables will be created in the database automatically.

Since the application doesn't provided the feature to create Users and UserRoles, enter sample data
in the respective tables so that the application can be used with various types of user and user roles.

USE student_tracker_db;

INSERT INTO users(username, password) VALUES('tanuj@user','pass');
INSERT INTO users(username, password) VALUES('paraste@admin','pass');
INSERT INTO users(username, password) VALUES('kumar@guest','pass');

INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('USER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ADMIN');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('GUEST');

INSERT INTO users_roles(user_id, role_id) VALUES(1,1);
INSERT INTO users_roles(user_id, role_id) VALUES(2,2);
INSERT INTO users_roles(user_id, role_id) VALUES(3,3);

Now, the application can be run and tested with the users created above.

Given below is the list of users and operations they can perform.

tanuj@user -- view student list, add a student only
paraste@admin -- all operations i.e. view student list, add, update and delete a student
kumar@guest -- view student list only

Expected behaviour: A user is forbidden to perform an action which is not listed above.
